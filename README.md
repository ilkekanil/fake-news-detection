# fake-news-detection
A Python-based project for classifying news articles as real or fake using both machine learning and deep learning approaches.
Implements:

Naive Bayes, Custom Logistic Regression, Random Forest

LSTM and CNN models with Keras/TensorFlow

Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, lowercasing)

Feature extraction via TF-IDF and sequence tokenization

Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and precision-recall curves

Dataset:

True.csv → real news articles

Fake.csv → fake news articles

Labels: 1 = Real, 0 = Fake
